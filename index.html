<h2>What im about to talk. is (Astronomy).</h2>
<h2>Astronomy. is a natural science</h2>
<h2>that studies celestial objects and phenomena.</h2>
<h2>It uses mathematics,Physics and chemistry.</h2>
<h3>Objects of interesting are.</h3>
<li>Planets</li>
<li>moons</li>
<li>stars</li>
<li>nebulas</li>
<li>black holes</li>
<hr/>
<h2>Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences.</h2>
<h2>The early civilizations in recorded history made methodical observations of the night sky. These include the Babylonians, Greeks, Indians, Egyptians, Chinese, Maya,</h2>
<h2>Nowadays, professional astronomy is often said to be the same as astrophysics.</h2>
<h2>Astronomy is one of the few sciences in which amateurs play an active role. This is especially true for the discovery and observation of transient events. Amateur astronomers have helped with many important discoveries, such as finding new comets.</h2>
<h2>We all know that in our solar system there are 8 planets. and 16 in general. (Including dwarf planets)</h2>
<h2>
<h2>Just IMAGINE a life on other planet. Meet other life forms. become friends.
  There maybe 39 civilisations. </h2>
<h2>Or the Black Holes!. a fantastic phenomenon</h2>
<h2>A gravity monsters. Spinning,calm or massive.</h2>
<br>
<h2>In 2019, Astronomers Capture First Image of a Black Hole</h2>

<!-- Now lets change the EHT section to an actual section element -->

      <h3 style="margin-left: 25px;">The image reveals the black hole at the center of Messier 87 [1], a massive galaxy in the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster. This black hole resides 55 million light-years from Earth and has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun [2]. </h3>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px;">[1] The shadow of a black hole is the closest we can come to an image of the black hole itself, a completely dark object from which light cannot escape. The black hole’s boundary — the event horizon from which the EHT takes its name — is around 2.5 times smaller than the shadow it casts and measures just under 40 billion km across. </p>
      <p style="margin-left: 25px;">[2] Supermassive black holes are relatively tiny astronomical objects — which has made them impossible to directly observe until now. As a black hole’s size is proportional to its mass, the more massive a black hole, the larger the shadow. Thanks to its enormous mass and relative proximity, M87’s black hole was predicted to be one of the largest viewable from Earth — making it a perfect target for the EHT. </p>

<h3>The gravity of black hole is SO massive. that even photons (light) cant escape!</h3>
<h3>The *singularity* point in black hole where [Time dies] and {Space is curved to zero point}</h3>
<h3>The Ultra Massive black hole.  is the biggest in the known universe is. TON 618.</h3>
<h3>Its the brightest cluster ever found. its brightens overbright other object in near radius.</h3>
<h3>Its 30 billion l.years away. BUT just becouse of its brightens.</h3>
<h3>In 1970, a radio survey at Bologna discovered radio emission from TON 618, indicating that it was a quasar. Marie-Helene Ulrich then obtained optical spectra of TON 618 at the McDonald Observatory which showed emission lines typical of a quasar. From the redshift of the lines Ulrich deduced that TON 618 was very distant, and hence was one of the most luminous quasars known.</h3>
<h3>There can be black holes bigger than TON 618. 100 billion suns and more. Also known as STUPENDOUSLY LARGE BLACK HOLE</h3>

<h3>Sooo. lets return to singularity and Gravity.</h3>
<h3>For example. *interstellar* movie, It was explained. when in Event Horizon time slow down until point of completely death.</h3>

<h3>The time on planet oribitng in Accertion disk radius. 1 Hour on that planet= 23 years on earth</h3>
<h3>So. what is Accretion   disk?</h3>
<br>
<img src="img/blackholeanimated.gif"> <br/>
<h3>An accretion disk is a structure (often a circumstellar disk) formed by diffuse material in orbital motion around a massive central body. The central body is typically a star. Friction causes orbiting material in the disk to spiral inward towards the central body. Gravitational and frictional forces compress and raise the temperature of the material, causing the emission of electromagnetic radiation. The frequency range of that radiation depends on the central object's mass. Accretion disks of young stars and protostars radiate in the infrared; those around neutron stars and black holes in the X-ray part of the spectrum. The study of oscillation modes in accretion disks is referred to as diskoseismology.</h3>
<hr/>
<h2> Or other astronomical Phenomenon. a star death. a NEUTRON star</h2>
<h3>A dead star with huge gravity. Fastest spinning object</h3>
<img src="img/neutroned.gif">
<h2>A little about neutron stars</h2>
<h3>**A neutron star is the collapsed core of a massive supergiant star, which had a total mass of between 10 and 25 solar masses, possibly more if the star was especially metal-rich.**</h3>
<h3>**Neutron stars are the smallest and densest stellar objects, excluding black holes and hypothetical white holes, quark stars, and strange stars.**</h3>
<h3>There are thought to be around one billion neutron stars in the Milky Way</h3>
<h2>{Official NASA information about neutron stars.}</h2>

<hr/>
<h2>Or the beautiful objects. Nebulas.</h2>
<h3>A nebula (Latin for 'cloud' or 'fog'; pl. nebulae, nebulæ or nebulas) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases</h3>
<h3>Most nebulae are of vast size; some are hundreds of light-years in diameter. A nebula that is visible to the human eye from Earth would appear larger, but no brighter, from close by</h3>
<h3> the formations of gas, dust, and other materials "clump" together to form denser regions, which attract further matter, and eventually will become dense enough to form stars. The remaining material is then believed to form planets and other planetary system objects.</h3>

<h2>The Galaxies</h2>
<h3>A Place where planets and stars are born.</h3>
<h3>A place that held by massive black hole</h3>
<h3>Galaxies formed billion and billion years ago.</h3>
<h3>Our home galaxy. Milky Way.</h3>
<img src="img/milky.jpg">
<h3>formed by Black Hole Sagittarius A*</h3>
<img src="img/sagg.jpg">
<h3>The Milky Way galaxy neighbors are Andromeda. and Triangulum and FAR away the Sombrero galaxy.</h3>
<h3>Milky Way have 2 its own moons</h3>
<li>Small Magellanic cloud</li>
<li>Large magellanic cloud</li>
<br>
<p><img src="img/magel.png"></p>
<h3>Even Andromeda galaxy have its own 2 moons!</h3>
<hr/>
<h3> what is Andromeda Galaxy?</h3>
<h3>Andromeda is our neighbor and the closest galaxy</h3>
<h3>The Andromeda Galaxy (IPA: /ænˈdrɒmɪdə/), also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224 and originally the Andromeda Nebula (see below), is a barred spiral galaxy approximately 2.5 million light-years (770 kiloparsecs) from Earth and the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way.</h3>

<h1>So lets return to our Solar System.</h1>
<h2> </h2>
<img src="img/ss.jpg">
<h3>Nearly 5 billion years ago formed our Solar system.</h3>
<h4>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest are the eight planets,[d] with the remainder being smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the moons—two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.[e]
  The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with the majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.
  The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these populations, some objects are large enough to have rounded under their own gravity, though there is considerable debate as to how many there will prove to be. Such objects are categorized as dwarf planets. The only certain dwarf planet is Pluto, with another trans-Neptunian object, Eris, expected to be, and the asteroid Ceres at least close to being a dwarf planet. In addition to these two regions, various other small-body populations, including comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, the six largest possible dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites, usually termed "moons" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects.
  The solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the interstellar medium known as the heliosphere. The heliopause is the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends out to the edge of the scattered disc. The Oort cloud, which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the Orion Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way galaxy. </h4>
<h2>The orbits are anti-clockwise.</h2>
<h3>Only neptune moon. *Triton* Orbit clockwise</h3>
<img src="img/solarorbits.gif">
<h2>Also fun fact. The fastest self orbit planet is Jupiter. only 10 hours is 1 day for Jupiter</h2>
<h2>The slowest is Venus. 1 day is longer than 1 year for venus</h2>
<img src="img/orbittime.gif">
<h2>Remember. Mercury is not the hottest planet. Venus are!</h2>
<img src="img/venus.gif">
<h3>Becouse of its atmosphere and clouds. By the GreenHouse effect. alot the heat stays on the venus surface. only small % of heat can escape.</h3>
